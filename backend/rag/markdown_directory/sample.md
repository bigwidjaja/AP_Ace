2 Questions
Directions: You have 50 minutes to answer BOTH of the following questions. It is not enough to answer a question
by merely listing facts. You should present a cogent argument based on your critical analysis of the questions posed,
using appropriate psychological terminology. You may plan your answers in this orange booklet, but no credit will be
given for anything written in this booklet. You will only earn credit for what you write in the separate Free
Response booklet.
1. Gavin’s parents took him to his favorite science museum, and he explored all of the exhibits. One of the
interactive exhibits featured glass marbles. He grabbed a large marble and tried to bounce it on the ground. At
one point during the visit, he became separated from his parents, and it took a few minutes for them to find
him. Later that night, he drew a colorful picture of the exhibits at the museum. The next day, Gavin brought his
picture with him to preschool. While his grandmother drove, Gavin talked to her about the picture.
Part A
• Explain how Jean Piaget’s concept of assimilation could relate to Gavin’s experience with the
glass marble.
• Explain how egocentrism could relate to how Gavin interacted with his grandmother in the car.
• Explain how avoidant attachment could relate to Gavin when he was separated from his parents.
Part B
Explain how each of the following terms could relate to Gavin in this scenario.
• Serial position effect
• Motor cortex

2. Professor Gonzalez hypothesizes that students will remember more information from his detailed course
description if it is printed on yellow paper than if it is printed on standard white paper. To test this hypothesis,
he put the names of all his students into a bowl, then drew out names to assign them to two different groups. He
gave one group of the students in his class a course description printed on white paper, and gave the other
group of students a course description printed on yellow paper. Students were instructed to thoroughly read the
description outside of class in preparation for their next class. In the next class, he gave all students a
ten-question quiz asking them about the information found on the course description. Professor Gonzalez then
compared the number of correct answers for each group of students. The statistically significant results are
depicted in the graph.
Part A
• State the operational definition of the dependent variable.
• Identify the experimental group.
• In addition to the manipulation of an independent variable, identify the procedure Professor
Gonzalez used to make this study a true experiment.
• Explain how the data as presented in the graph do or do not support Professor Gonzalez’s
hypothesis.
Part B
Explain how each of the following might relate to a student’s performance on any quiz.
• Context-dependent memory
• Yerkes-Dodson law
• Low level of the Big Five trait of conscientiousness
