1. Crossing over in meiosis I is required for homologous chromosomes to properly align during metaphase and
segregate during the first cell division.
(a)
(i) Describe the function of S phase of interphase.
Some regions of a chromosome called hotspots display a higher frequency of crossing over than other regions
do. Crossing over is suppressed in chromosomal regions near the centromeres. The centromere region of a
duplicated chromosome includes a collection of proteins that form a structure called the kinetochore. Scientists
hypothesized that one or more of these kinetochore proteins are responsible for suppressing crossing over
around the centromere.
To investigate their hypothesis, scientists modified chromosome 8 in yeast such that, in each cell, one
chromosome from the pair of homologous chromosome 8s contained the gene encoding red fluorescent protein
(RFP), while the other chromosome from the pair contained the gene encoding green fluorescent protein
(GFP). Cells expressing RFP emit (give off) red light, and cells expressing GFP emit green light. Models of the
modified chromosome 8 both before and after crossing over are shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Models of modified chromosome 8 used in the experiment (A) before and (B)
after crossing over occurs at the hotspot
(ii) Explain why some haploid cells formed after meiosis in this experiment will have only one
fluorescent marker.

The scientists then investigated whether attaching individual kinetochore proteins to a specific DNA sequence
present in a known crossing-over hotspot on chromosome 8 affected the frequency of crossing over at this
location. In their first experiment, they examined three groups of yeast cells containing the modified
chromosome 8. Group 1 contained no kinetochore proteins attached to the hotspot, group 2 contained the
kinetochore protein CTF attached to the hotspot, and group 3 contained the kinetochore protein IML attached
to the hotspot. For each group, the scientists determined the frequency of crossing over between the RFP and
GFP genes. To determine the frequency, the scientists added the number of cells emitting both red and green
light to the number of cells that emitted no light and divided by the total number of cells (Figure 2).
Figure 2. The frequency of crossing over
in a hotspot on yeast chromosome 8 for
cell groups treated with different
kinetochore proteins. Error bars represent
±2SE x .
(b)
(i) Identify the control group for the scientists’ first experiment, shown in Figure 2.
(ii) In a follow-up experiment, the scientists created a modified version of CTF in which the
DNA-binding portion had been removed. They compared the frequency of crossing over in yeast cells
in the presence and absence of unmodified CTF with that in yeast cells in the presence and absence of
the modified CTF protein (data not shown). In the follow-up experiment, justify why the scientists
used a modified CTF protein that is unable to bind to DNA as a control.
(iii) Identify the independent variable in the follow-up experiment.
(c) Based on Figure 2, describe the effect on the frequency of crossing over when CTF is attached to the
chromosome 8 hotspot compared with the effect when IML is attached to the hotspot.
(d)
(i) Predict the effect on the number of copies of chromosome 8 likely to be present in the resulting
daughter cells when CTF is attached to the hotspot.
(ii) Provide reasoning to justify your prediction.
(iii) Explain how the presence of hotspots (Figure 1) could increase the likelihood that a population will
survive in the presence of selective pressures.

3. To investigate whether red blood cells of animals lose the ability to take in glucose from their environment as
they age, scientists collected red blood cells from guinea pigs that ranged in age from one day old to seven
months old. Scientists incubated an equal number of red blood cells in separate culture dishes that contained a
300 nM solution of radioactively labeled glucose. The amount of radioactively labeled glucose present inside
the red blood cells of each group was measured over time.
(a) Describe a difference between passive transport and active transport.
(b) Justify why the scientists used an equal number of red blood cells in each culture dish as a control.
(c) Glucose transporters are required for the facilitated diffusion of glucose into red blood cells. The scientists
claim that the expression of the gene encoding these transporters decreases as guinea pigs age. If the
scientists’ claim is supported by experimental data, predict the effect of increased age on the amount of
radioactively labeled glucose present inside the cells of each group.

4. The common wild oat is native to regions of Europe and Asia but is an invasive species in central California
grasslands. In California, the common wild oat has almost completely replaced some species of native
bunchgrass. Researchers found that aphids, a type of small insect that often carries plant viruses, have a much
higher reproductive rate in grasslands that include the common wild oat than in grasslands composed of only
native bunchgrass species. Additionally, the viruses carried by the aphids appear to affect only the native
bunchgrasses and not the common wild oat. Native bunchgrasses infected by the virus have much higher death
rates than do native bunchgrasses that are not infected.
(a) Describe the change in the resilience of an ecosystem when there is a decrease in the number of species.
(b) Explain how the addition of the common wild oat affects the number of native bunchgrass plants that can
be supported by the California grasslands ecosystem.
(c) Researchers suggest adding ladybugs, predators of aphids, to the California grasslands. Predict the effect of
adding ladybugs on the abundance of the native bunchgrass population.
(d) Justify your prediction in part (c).

5. Researchers study mechanisms that enable or prevent speciation.
(a) Describe a post-zygotic mechanism that prevents gene flow and thus enables speciation.
New genes can evolve from noncoding regions of DNA. It is not until certain regulatory elements are present in
the DNA that a noncoding region becomes a new, functional gene that encodes a protein. These regulatory
elements include a promoter, a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) followed by a start codon, and a 3′ UTR
following a stop codon (Figure 1).

ag gene

Researchers studied the evolution of the family of antifreeze-glycoprotein (AG) encoding genes in Gadidae, a
family of marine fish known as cods. When present in the fish, these glycoproteins reduce the freezing
temperature of the fish. The researchers compared genomic sequences in nine cod species and one non-cod fish
species, B. brosme. They recorded the presence or absence of the elements of functional ag genes as well as
ag-like sequences that are similar to a functional gene but have undergone mutation and do not contain all the
elements required to enable protein production (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Phylogenetic tree showing the evolution of ag genes
(b) Based on the data in Figure 2, explain how changes to the genome enabled cods to survive and reproduce
after a period of freezing temperatures between 10 and 15 million years ago.
(c) Using the template in the space provided for your response, place an “X” on the phylogenetic tree to
represent the origin of the functional ag gene.
(d) Based on Figure 2, explain how genetic differences among the species in the Gadidae family determine the
habitats in which they can survive.

6. Scientists can quantify the rate of translation as ribosomes move along an mRNA from one codon to the next.
Using a procedure called ribosome profiling, the scientists measured how long a ribosome remains stationary at
each codon of each mRNA. They determined the average translation rate across all codons is 5.2 amino acids
per second but that the average translation rate for specific codons in different mRNA sequences can vary
widely. These variations in translation rates are thought to facilitate correct folding of the protein being
produced. The rate at which three different codons were translated was measured in 100 different mRNAs. The
scientists determined the distribution of rate (number of times each rate was recorded) for each of the three
codons: GAC (Figure 1A), AUU (Figure 1B), and UGG (Figure 1C).
Figure 1. The distribution of translation rates for three different codons (A) GAC, (B) AUU, and (C) UGG

(a) Using the data in Figure 1, graph A, identify the rate (in ms/codon) that was recorded the greatest number
of times for the GAC codon.
(b) Using the data in Figure 1, graphs B and C, describe the variation in translation rate of the AUU codon
compared with that of the UGG codon.
(c) Scientists hypothesize that tRNA molecules that bind to UGG codons are available in lower abundance than
are tRNAs that bind to AUU codons. Support the scientists’ hypothesis using the data in Figure 1.
(d) Amino acids can be encoded by multiple codons. In many organisms, certain codons for the same amino
acid occur more frequently in an mRNA than do other codons. Based on the data provided, explain why the
use of one codon over another for the same amino acid might result in increased levels of protein production
from a particular mRNA.
