1. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in order to more effectively enforce
federal environmental protection laws. As an independent agency within the federal bureaucracy, the EPA’s
mission is “to protect human health and the environment.” Throughout its history, the EPA has supported the
executive branch by enforcing legislation intended to regulate automobile emissions, increase household
recycling, and ban the use of harmful pesticides.
Americans have debated how much flexibility the EPA should have to enforce and interpret existing law. Some
prefer the EPA to have more flexibility in implementing laws so that it can better protect common interests like
clean water and biodiversity. On the other hand, others claim that the EPA has too much flexibility in
implementing laws, allowing the agency to impose unnecessary and burdensome regulations that hurt business,
and that its flexibility in implementing policy should be limited.
Recent actions are consistent with this debate. For example, under one administration, the EPA interpreted
existing environmental laws in new ways, further limiting toxic emissions from automobiles and power plants.
However, under the following administration, the EPA implemented a narrower interpretation, which led to the
rollback of recent restrictions in the name of free enterprise and limited government.
After reading the scenario, please respond to A, B, and C below.
A. Describe the power that the EPA used in the scenario to change how it implemented environmental
laws under different administrations.
B. Explain how the power described in part A could be affected by the president.
C. Explain how Congress could attempt to influence the actions of the bureaucratic agency in the
scenario.

This question requires you to compare a Supreme Court case you studied in class with one you have not studied
in class. A summary of the Supreme Court case you did not study in class is presented below and provides all of
the information you need to know about this case to answer the prompts.
Katzenbach v. McClung (1964)
3. Beginning in 1927, the McClung family owned a restaurant that served barbecue and other foods to patrons.
Their restaurant was located about eleven blocks from an interstate highway and obtained about half of its
supplies from out of state. Even though the restaurant had an indoor seating capacity of over 200, it refused to
seat African Americans and restricted them to take-out orders.
Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination in places of public
accommodation. It was passed based on economic activity, given the travel of African Americans between
states. However, the McClungs sued to prevent the enforcement of the Civil Rights Act. They argued that
because the restaurant purchased half of its food from an in-state supplier, Congress could not regulate it
because its activities were local in nature.
After a district court ruled in favor of the restaurant, the federal government appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, held that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was constitutional,
upholding Congress’ power to prohibit discrimination when it poses a significant burden to interstate
commerce. The Court reasoned that because the restaurant purchased about half of its food from an out-of-state
supplier and because Congress sought to resolve the problem of discrimination that was a national issue,
Congress had the power to enact the legislation that regulated the restaurant.
A. Identify the constitutional clause that is common to both United States v. Lopez (1995) and Katzenbach v.
McClung (1964).
B. Explain how the facts in United States v. Lopez and Katzenbach v. McClung resulted in different holdings.
C. Explain how the decision in Katzenbach v. McClung reflects the democratic ideal of natural rights.
